# Oreopolis-mini-coursework
"Miner's Treasure Hunt" is a text-based game created in C, where players take on the role of a daring Miner, exploring a virtual mining site known as Oreopolis. Your goal is to unearth valuable minerals while navigating a 2D world that consists of a grid, with a minimum size of 12x12 cells.
As a resourceful miner, you'll embark on a thrilling quest through Oreopolis, searching for precious ores and gems hidden deep within the earth
## Requirements and game mechanics:
- Unearth valuable minerals, gems and ore scattered across the mining site.
- Traverse the mining site while avoiding at least 3 cells that are impassable, marked by natural obstacles.
-	The placement of valuable minerals is randomized at the beginning of each game, offering a unique mining experience every time.
-	Each cell in the world can contain only one type of minable material at a time.
-	Your character, the intrepid miner, is under your control and moves one cell at a time in the up, down, left and right directions (but not diagonally).
-	Ensure that your miner remains within the boundaries of Oreopolis.
-	The character can carry a fixed number of mined materials at a time (could this be upgradable at an in-game shop, perhaps? Does each type of ore/gem have its own weight?).
-	The character only has enough limited resource (perhaps air, light, energy, time) that can be refreshed according to a game mechanic of your choice, and the player will lose the game should your character run out of this resource.
-	An inventory system allows you to manage your mined collection, to see your tools and any items or upgrades the player has. Display the player’s inventory whenever needed.
-	The character should be able to sell mined materials at a shop (also the starting point of the game). 
-	The game is won when the character makes sufficient money from selling ore and gems. 
-	The game’s difficulty should be chosen by the user and should feature an element of scalable difficulty, perhaps more valuable mineable items are scarcer, or lower starting resource.
-	Read some data from a text file (i.e. Level settings, an introduction text?)
-	Write some data to a text file (i.e. Leaderboard of scores?)
-	Will you rise to the challenge of the "Miner's Treasure Hunt" and uncover the riches hidden within Oreopolis? Enter the exciting world of mining, improve your C programming skills, and emerge as a seasoned miner in this thrilling adventure!
